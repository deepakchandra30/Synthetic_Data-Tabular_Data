# Machine Learning - Synthetic Data Generation
=============================================

## Overview
------------

This phase aims to generate synthetic data for the Bovine Tuberculosis open dataset.

## Getting Started
-------------------

To execute the code, follow the order below:

### 1. Base Code
### 2. Generative Model (CTGAN / TVAE / GaussianCopula)
### 3. Evaluation Code

## Libraries Used
------------------

* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
* **SDV**: For synthetic data generation
* **Table Evaluator**: For evaluation of generated data

## Code Documentation
----------------------

All code has been thoroughly commented for a detailed understanding. For more information, please refer to the files on eDocs.

## Note
--------

Please ensure to have the required files & follow the order of execution to generate synthetic data successfully.
